"""Class taxonomy and the CubiCasa-token → class mapping.

Four classes. `floor` is the default fill (every pixel starts there).
Walls, doors, windows are painted on top in that order, so doors and windows
overwrite walls where they overlap (which matches the actual architecture —
a door is an opening *in* a wall).
